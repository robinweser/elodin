# Conditionals

Conditionals add a special syntax to apply styles only a **condition** is fulfilled.<br/>
They're written in square brackets and depending on the type of comparison support only equal comparison or all comparison operators.

## Comparison Operators

| Operator | Description                                                                                                      |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| =        | Matches if the value is exactly the same.<br />Commonly used with [variants](/docs/language/variants).           |
| >        | Matches if the value greater than a given number.<br />_Only supported for integer and float types._             |
| >=       | Matches if the value greater than or equal to a given number.<br />_Only supported for integer and float types._ |
| <        | Matches if the value less than a given number.<br />_Only supported for integer and float types._                |
| <=       | Matches if the value less than or equal to a given number.<br />_Only supported for integer and float types._    |

## Variant Comparison

The most simple conditions are variant checks which we've seen in the [Variant](/docs/language/variants) docs before.

### Example

```elodin
variant Mode {
  Dark
  Light
}

view Button {
  padding: 10
  [Mode=Dark] {
    backgroundColor: black
  }

  [Mode=White] {
    backgroundColor: white
  }
}
```

## Environment Conditionals

Apart from variants, some generators also implement special environment conditionals such as pseudo classes and media queries for web-specific generators.<br />
Some environment variables are boolean types, which means they don't use a comparison operator at all.

### Example

```elodin
view Button {
  padding: 10
  backgroundColor: black
  [@hover] {
    backgroundColor: rgb(40 40 40)
  }
  [@viewportWidth>=1024] {
    padding: 15
  }
}
```
