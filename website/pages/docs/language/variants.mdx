# Variants

Variants help to define different variations of a single style without having to use variables.<br />
Usually, you'll use variants if you have a known number of static variations.

Variants are used together with [Conditionals](/docs/language/conditionals) and can only be compared using an equal comparison.

## Example

```
variant ThemeMode {
  Dark
  Light
}

view Button {
  padding: 10
  [ThemeMode=Dark] {
    backgroundColor: black
  }

  [ThemeMode=Light] {
    backgroundColor: white
  }
}
```

Variants can also be nested to specify styles that are only applied of both conditions are met.

## Example

```
variant ThemeMode {
  Dark
  Light
}

variant Size {
  Normal
  Small
}

view Button {
  padding: 10
  width: 100
  [ThemeMode=Dark] {
    backgroundColor: black
    [Size=Normal] {
      width: 150
    }

    [Size=Small] {
      width: 80
    }
  }
}
```
