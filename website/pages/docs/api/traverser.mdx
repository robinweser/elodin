# Traverser

`@elodin/traverser`

The traverser takes an AST, transform its nodes and returns a new AST.<br />
It traverses (thus the name) the tree reaching each node once.

## traverse

The `traverse` method takes an ast and a list of visitors.

### Example

```javascript
import { parse } from '@elodin/parser'
import { traverse } from '@elodin/traverser'

const input = `
view Button {
  backgroundColor: red
  paddingLeft: 10
  paddingRight: 10
}
`

// this visitors adds 5 to every Integer node
const visitors = {
  Integer: {
    enter(path) {
      path.node.value += 5
    },
  },
}

const ast = traverse(parse(input), visitors)
```

## Visitors

A visitor contains an `enter` and/or `exit` function for a specific AST node type.<br />
Enter is called once the AST node is reached while exit is called once the AST node with its sub nodes was fully processed. <br />
Both are called with a `path` object.

### Path

The path object contains all data and methods for the current AST node.

| replaceNode | A function that takes an AST node to replace the current AST node. _Note_: Only available for container AST nodes |
| removeNode  | Removes the current AST node from its parent                                                                      |
